### Important Reminders

- You will upload your homework to the [Crowdmark website](crowdmark.com). Look out for an email with a link to the upload page. Note that this will involve uploading each homework problem as a separate document.
- Homeworks must be typed. Some options for this include word, overleaf/latex, or by including a pdf of a jupyter notebook (not the .ipynb file please!). Some students have had more success in the jupyter case of printing from the browser window.  The "convert to pdf" option requires you to have latex installed.
- Including figures when explaining your reasoning is highly encouraged.  This can be done as easily as taking a picture of a hand-drawn sketch and including it in your file. Please be sure to include all figures in the main file so we only have to look at one uploaded pdf or document.
- I strongly encourage collaboration.  In the case that you work with others in the class, please include an acknowledgement section in your homework, mentioning people and resources you used in completing the assignment. While utilizing resources such as the internet and the textbook are encouraged, direct copy-paste is not.  
You should always be able to explain any of your solutions to me after the fact.
- The late homework policy is:
  - Full credit if submitted on D2L by midnight Friday.
  - 5% penalty if submitted by midnight Saturday.
  - 15% penalty if submitted by midnight Sunday.
  - No credit after Sunday.
  - At the end of the semester, the two lowest homework scores will be dropped.
